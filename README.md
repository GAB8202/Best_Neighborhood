This dataset contains census data from 2010 for the city of Pittsburgh based on neighborhood. There are many different datasets contained such as population density, public safety, transportation, etc.

## Abstract
Our group found that the best neighborhood was Reagant Square. Using the metrics of Public safety, which was based on the lowest amount of crime per 100 persons, population under the poverty line, the lower the percent the better, and housing conditions, based on population density and quality of buildings. These three criteria were evaluated each seperately and then scored. These scores were added together at the end with each category awarding first 10 pts, second 7 pts, third 3 pts, and 4-10 1 pt. Using this information Reagant Square scored a total of 17 points, due to its high performance in population under poverty line and housing conditions, but it did not perform so well in public safety.
